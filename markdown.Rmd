## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
log <- eventlog(data, case_id = "Case ID", activity_id = "Activity", activity_instance_id = "activityID", lifecycle_id = "lifecycle:transition", timestamp = "Complete Timestamp", resource_id = "Resource")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
log %>% process_map()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
